# Inventracker App

## Overview
Inventracker is an user-friendly iOS app designed to help you effortlessly organize and manage your recipes and kitchen inventory. Primarily focused on small food retail businesses, it provides an intuitive interface to keep track of your favorite recipes, create shopping lists, and ensure that you never run out of essential ingredients. **The purpose of the app is not, for now, to teach you how to cook,** but to keep track of the recipes you make/sell and the ingredients you have, and therefore profit and cost.

## Features
+ Easily add, edit and delete recipes, ingredients, purchases and sales.
+ Each recipe contains essential information such as ingredients and costs of the recipe itself and each ingredient.
+ Each recipe includes a very descriptive chart showing the cost distribution of the ingredients.
+ Automatically updates ingredient quantities as you use them in recipes or when you purchase new items.
+ When you make a sale, the app calculates the profit and builds a graph showing past sales.

## Installation
The app is an Xcode project, and you only need to clone it and work on it.

## Technical Details
The app is built in Swift, using Apple's SwiftUI and Core Data frameworks. The app is currently targeting iOS 16.0.
